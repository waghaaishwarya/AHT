# Atmospheric Heat Transport (AHT) Analysis – CO₂ Forcing Scenarios

This repository contains Python code and visualizations for analyzing **Atmospheric Heat Transport (AHT)** under 4×CO₂ and Pre-Industrial (PI) control scenarios using MPI-ESM climate model data. The methodology is based on the approach presented by **Aaron Donohoe et al. (2013)**.

## project overview

- Calculates meridional AHT using radiative and turbulent energy fluxes across latitudes
- Uses equations derived from the global energy budget of the atmosphere
- Compares transport trends for 4×CO₂ and PI scenarios
- Identifies anomalies in equatorial and hemispheric AHT distributions
- Generates dynamic GIF animations of transport patterns

## tools & libraries

- Python 3.13.3 
- `netCDF4`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `imageio`
